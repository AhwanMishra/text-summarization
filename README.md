# text-summarization
In this two types of text-summarization algorithms are implemented. These algorithms take
as input a text document that contains a number of sentences, each of which contains several words. The
output is a summary of a given number of sentences. The summarization algorithms generate the summary by
selecting some of the sentences in the document, that are deemed to be important
(this process is known as ‘extractive’ summarization).

For this assignment, I have used these Python modules: 
NLTK (for text processing), 
NetworkX (for graph processing)
Numpy (for numerical computations, such as matrix operations).
